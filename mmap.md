Feasibility of Memory Maps (mmap)
Yes, using memory maps (mmap) is not only feasible but also highly recommended for reading CDB files. It's a classic optimization for this exact scenario.

A memory-mapped file allows you to treat the entire file on disk as if it were a slice of bytes ([]byte) in memory. The operating system handles loading pages of the file into physical RAM as you access them.

Advantages
ðŸš€ Performance: Accessing the data becomes a simple slice operation instead of a ReadAt syscall. This eliminates the overhead of syscalls and copying data from kernel space to user space buffers. The OS's virtual memory manager is highly optimized for this and will intelligently cache frequently accessed parts of the file.

ðŸ’» Simpler Code: The reader logic becomes much simpler. Instead of passing an io.ReaderAt around and allocating temporary buffers for reads, you would just hold a single []byte slice representing the entire file.

For example, readTuple could be rewritten from this:

Go

func readTuple(r io.ReaderAt, offset uint32) (uint32, uint32, error) {
tuple := make([]byte, 8)
_, err := r.ReadAt(tuple, int64(offset))
// ...
first := binary.LittleEndian.Uint32(tuple[:4])
// ...
}
To this, which involves no new memory allocations or syscalls:

Go

// The 'data' parameter is the memory-mapped file slice.
func readTuple(data []byte, offset uint32) (uint32, uint32) {
tupleSlice := data[offset : offset+8]
first := binary.LittleEndian.Uint32(tupleSlice[:4])
second := binary.LittleEndian.Uint32(tupleSlice[4:])
return first, second
}
Considerations
Platform Specificity: mmap syscalls are not part of the standard Go library, but they are available in the widely-used golang.org/x/sys package for all major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows, BSDs).

Resource Management: You must explicitly unmap the file (Munmap) when you are done with it, just as you must Close a file handle. This would be handled in the CDB.Close() method.

Given that CDB files are read-only and benefit from random access, mmap is a perfect architectural fit that would likely yield a significant performance boost for read-heavy workloads.
